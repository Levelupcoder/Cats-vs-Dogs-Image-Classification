# Cats-vs-Dogs-Image-Classification
The Cats vs Dogs image classification project uses deep learning models to classify images of cats and dogs. It involves preprocessing the data, training deep learning models using convolutional neural networks, and evaluating their accuracy. The project has applications in animal recognition and surveillance systems.

Data

The project uses a dataset of labeled images of cats and dogs. The dataset is split into training and testing sets and pre-processed for use in the deep learning models. The data includes images and labels indicating whether each image is of a cat or a dog

Methodology

The project uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify the images. Several deep learning models, including VGG16, InceptionV3, and ResNet50, are trained on the pre-processed data to identify patterns and characteristics of cats and dogs. The models are evaluated based on their accuracy in correctly classifying the images.

Dependencies

The project is built using Python and requires several dependencies, including Keras, TensorFlow, and NumPy.

Results

The project achieves an accuracy of over 90% in classifying images of cats and dogs. The results can be used for animal recognition and surveillance systems.

Conclusion

The Cats vs Dogs image classification project is an important tool for accurately classifying images of cats and dogs in real-world settings. It can be extended to other animal recognition tasks and can be adapted to specific domains and use cases.
